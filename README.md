# Multivitamin-s-Side-Effects
Multivitamin's Side Effects Multivitamins can be helpful for those who are unable to reach their daily nutrient need through diet alone. But multivitamins can not replace a balanced diet and taking them in high amounts may result in side effects ranging from mild stomach upset to severe liver, nausea, diarrhea, flushing, unpleasant taste, and heart problems may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, notify your doctor or pharmacist. If your doctor has prescribed this medication, remember that your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Though it is possible to meet your nutrient needs by consuming a balanced diet, some people may fall short of the daily needed amounts of vitamins and minerals. So, it's best to talk with your health care specialist before taking any multivitamin supplements.
